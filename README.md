# EvoRecSys

Evolutionary Recommender System (EvoRecSys) is a simple Recommender System for wellbeing based on Genetic Algorithms. The recommendations provided by it are bundles which contain:

1) A set of food items (a meal can be cooked with them).
2) A suggested time to spend on a suggested physical activity.

EvoRecSys needs to build recommendations your physical status, your food preferences and your physical activity preferences...Don't worry! EvoRecSys will ask you about it.
