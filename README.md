> # EvoRecSys

Evolutionary Recommender System (EvoRecSys) is a simple Recommender System for wellbeing based on Genetic Algorithms. The recommendations provided by it are bundles which contain:

1. A set of food items (a meal can be cooked with them).

2. A suggested time to spend on a suggested physical activity.

To build recommendations EvoRecSys needs your physical status, your food preferences and your physical activity preferences...Don't worry! EvoRecSys will ask you about it.
